"""Guard against payment and fund-transfer requests.

Same rule Anakin's MCP server applies to its write tools: `wire_write_action`,
`wire_build` and `browser_task` refuse anything that looks like it completes
a payment or moves money (pay, checkout, purchase, place order, buy now,
wire transfer, remit, payout, charge card). Benign writes such as "add to
cart" or "submit a form" pass, and read actions are never checked.
